Privacy Policy


This app does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

The only interaction the app performs is sending a user-provided ID to an external API in order to retrieve a YouTube video link. This link is then opened in the official YouTube app or browser. No data is stored, logged, or shared with any third parties.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer.
